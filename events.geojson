The passion and idea behind it have remained the same: inclusivity for all.</p> <p>The event stretches over a week and is notorious for two things in particular: The events during the week and the Pride Parade. During the week, big tents are set up all over the city, where discussions, cultural events, workshops, sports events, bingos, and much more take place. Most of the events take place at City Hall Square, which is known as Pride Square, during the week. Most of the events are body-inclusive, so everyone can attend them. Many of the events are also in English, so more people can be included.</p> <p>Some of the previous events have included Drag Bingo, transgender rights discussions, queer asylum, DJs, friendship speed dating, dog meetups, alliances between minorities, family picnics, human rights talks, queer parenting classes, neurodivergent discussions, and silent discos. There simply is something for everyone, regards of gender, ethnicity, and sexuality.</p> <p>The icing on the cake is the Pride Parade that always takes place on the Saturday. The Parade starts in Frederiksberg and moves down Vesterbro to ultimately end at the City Hall Square. It is important to remember that while it is fun and people are partying, it is also a demonstration where LGBTQIA+ fight for acceptance and rights. You can either watch the parade or join in \u2013 everyone is welcome to join the fun as long as they remain respectful. As Lady Gaga put it, \u201cdon\u2019t be a drag, just be a queen!\u201c</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Every August, Copenhagen Pride takes place. While it is recognisable with glitter and glam and queers and queens, its seriousness cannot be undermined. It is a week full of activism to create a more inclusive Copenhagen \u2013 and world!</strong></p>"

The Hermitage Run is a run for everyone, organised by K\u00f8benhavns Idr\u00e6ts Forening and KS - K\u00f8benhavns Skiklub. The Hermitage Run \u00a0has always taken place in the beautiful surroundings of Dyrehaven in North Zealand, and is the<a href=\"https://elob.dk/\"> only fun run close to Copenhagen</a> that is organised in the garden. In 2015, Dyrehaven was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List, and it is known for the Hermitage Castle and the more than 2000 fallow deer that live in the garden. Dyrehaven has maintained its tranquillity while Copenhagen has grown around it. That's why The Hermitage Run is also known as the most beautiful running route in Denmark. The route is 13.3 km and is designed as a figure 8, so you pass the beautiful Hermitage Castle twice during the run.</p> <p>With a focus on nature and environmental protection, the Hermitage Run works with several different sustainability initiatives. Among other things, this year's water cups will be 100% compostable.</p> <p>The Hermitage Run started in 1969, when doctor Peter Schnohr from KIF (K\u00f8benhavns Idr\u00e6ts Forening) and dentist and Olympic skier Svend W. Carlsen from KS (K\u00f8benhavns Skiklub) came up with the idea for a marathon. Together with BT, they were allowed to create the Hermitage Run in Dyrehaven as one of the only running races in Denmark and the only running race ever in Dyrehaven. The run was the catalyst for an entire fitness movement in Denmark, and it is still Denmark's most beautiful and unique running race.</p> <p>As the only fun run in Dyrehaven, the Hermitage Run is recognised as one of Denmark's most beautiful and unique runs. Join the run when it takes place for the 54th time</p>"

The program is filled with concerts with national\u00a0 internationally renowned artists.</p> <p><strong>Tivoli has renewed the classical music program</strong></p> <p>Bring the family when Tivoli presents this year\u00b4s classical music program, SommerKlassisk, which replaces Tivoli Festival. Besides the new name, you can look forward to many new experiences in the coming season.\u00a0</p> <p>In 2016, SommerKlassisk gives 65 concerts on the big lawn in Tivoli. This includes intimate concerts and sing-along concerts. You will get the oportunity to experience several international top performers. 43 of the concerts are free, if you have a season pass to the Gardens.</p> <p><strong>A new Sunday tradition is starting</strong></p> <p>You can look forward to a new Tivoli tradition, The Sunday Matin\u00e9e. Every Sunday, during the summer, Tivoli presents new Sunday concerts. The program counts everything from the best new classical music talents to the Budapest Orchestra, who is awarded one of the world\u2019s top ten classical orchestras. The Sunday Matin\u00e9e starts at 15:00 every Sunday in the season.</p> <p><strong>Champagnegalop for children</strong></p> <p>In 2016, SommerKlassisk is also for children. Tivoli will open the classical music universe for the young people by giving them a different and sensuous music experience. This will happen by the launch of a new music amusement ride for children called \u201cChampagnegaloppen\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cChampagnegaloppen\u201d is a music caravan, where children meet musicians from the symphony orchestra, Tivoli Copenhagen Phil, children from Tivoli-Guard and Tivoli\u2019s ballet-school. A professional actor is hired to play Tivolis first musician chief, the component H.C. Lumbye. Lumbye guides the children through Champagnegaloppen, which moves from the Aquarium to Tivolis concerthalls. It is free to try Champagnegaloppen, which is set in motion every Saturday at 14:00 in the classical music season.</p> <p>You can find the program for the whole season here: <a title=\"SommerKlassisk\" href=\"http://www.tivoli.dk/da/sommerklassisk\">http://www.tivoli.dk/da/sommerklassisk</a></p>"
